        Happy 2nd Anniversary of "Us" and Your Special Day! My love, today is
        not just your birthday; it also marks two beautiful years of our journey
        together. From the moment we met, you have filled my life with love,
        laughter, and unforgettable memories. Every day with you is a blessing,
        and I am so grateful to have you by my side. On your special day, I want
        to remind you how deeply I love and appreciate you. May this year bring
        you endless happiness, success, and all the dreams your heart desires. I
        can't wait to create more memories with you and continue building our
        future together. Happy Birthday, my love! Here’s to many more years of
